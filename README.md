# Production Lets RP PD Documents

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site for Let's RP that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem;
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages.

[^1]: [It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site).
