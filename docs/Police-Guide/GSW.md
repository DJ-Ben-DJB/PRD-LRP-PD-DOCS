# GSW (Gunshot Wounds) 

Gunshot wounds (GSWs) are among the most critical and unpredictable injuries you’ll encounter. They can range from superficial grazes to deep-penetrating trauma that damages vital organs, arteries, and bones. Each GSW demands immediate attention—with your priorities being bleeding control, stabilization, and rapid transport or surgical intervention.

## At Scene Care

### Graze Wound (Skin Only)

- **Clean the wound** with saline.
- **Check if stitches are needed** (if deep or long).
- **Apply antibiotic ointment** (like Neosporin).
- **Cover with a clean bandage.**

### Through-and-Through (T&T) Wound  
(Bullet went in and out)

- **If bleeding a lot:** apply a **tourniquet** (only on arms or legs).
- **Clean both entry and exit wounds** with saline.
- **Seal both sides of the wound** with sterile dressing.
- **Wrap with a pressure bandage** to slow bleeding.

### Lodged Bullet (Still Inside)

- **If bleeding a lot:** apply a **tourniquet** (only on arms or legs).
- **Clean around the wound** with saline.
- **Apply pressure bandage**, but **do NOT pack the wound**—this could push the bullet deeper.
- **Get patient to the hospital ASAP.**
